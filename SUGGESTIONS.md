## Fictional Fate — Image + Sound Suggestions

### Start page (keep it clean + fun)

- CTA button: one obvious action only

**Hero image keyword ideas (Unsplash/Pexels):**
- `pink glow`, `neon heart`, `city lights`, `dreamy portrait`, `romantic bokeh`, `cute pastel`, `sparkles`

- “Your match is loading…”
- “Let’s find your Fictional Fate.”
- “5 swipes. 1 vibe. No shame.”
